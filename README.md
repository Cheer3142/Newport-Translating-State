# Newport-Translating-State

This is python script to control the Newport translating state and read analog input from NI instrument.
This is sub project in Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS). (Experiment purpose)

## Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS)
NARIT, in cooperation with Suranaree University of Technology (SUT), developed a Fourier transform spectrograph to observe deep-sky objects. It is a technique that uses interference of light and the Fourier transform to measure the spectrum of a substance. The spectrograph has high spectral dispersion at visible wavelengths and near infrared ranges. It also processes 3D data on the object under observation, which allows astronomers to investigate stars and planets that are swelling or shrinking. A prototype was developed and installed to the 0.7-meter diameter telescope at the Regional Observatory for the Public, Nakhon Ratchasima.
